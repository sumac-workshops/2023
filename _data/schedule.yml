  # Bio: Dr. Lu HOU is a researcher at the Speech and Semantics Lab in Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. She obtained Ph.D. from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. James T. Kwok. Her current research interests include compression and acceleration of deep neural networks, natural language processing, and deep learning optimization.
  # Abstract: Unsupervised large-scale vision-language pre-training has shown promising advances on various downstream tasks. Existing methods often model the cross-modal interaction either via the similarity of the global feature of each modality which misses sufficient information, or finer-grained interactions using cross/self-attention upon visual and textual tokens. However, cross/self-attention suffers from inferior efficiency in both training and inference. In this talk, we introduce a large-scale Fine-grained Interactive Language-Image Pre-training method to achieve finer-level alignment through a cross-modal late interaction mechanism, which uses a token-wise maximum similarity between visual and textual tokens to guide the contrastive objective. The resultant model FILIP and Wukong achieve good performance on multiple downstream vision-language tasks, while maintaining the inference efficiency of dual-stream models. The visualization on word-patch alignment further shows that FILIP can learn meaningful fine-grained features with promising localization ability. Furthermore, we release a 100 million Chinese image-text pair dataset for pre-training.

  # Bio: 'Professor Jimmy Lin holds the David R. Cheriton Chair in the David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. For a quarter of a century, his research has been driven by the quest to develop methods and build tools that connect users to  relevant information. His work mostly lies at the intersection of information retrieval and natural language processing, with a focus on two fundamental challenges: those of understanding and scale.'
  # Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) - the challenge of connecting users to previously stored relevant information - has received renewed  attention of late due to the advent of pretrained transformer-based  models. In recent years, we have seen the introduction of many new  types of models (e.g., dense and sparse learned representations,  cross-encoders, etc.) in the context of techniques that have been around for decades (e.g., BM25, multi-stage ranking, etc.). What does it mean for a search system to be efficient? In this talk, I'll try to sort through efficiency tradeoffs in the design and construction of end-to-end search systems, organized along the dimensions of time, space, and cost.
