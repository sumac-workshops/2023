<p>
The fifth version of the SUMAC (analySis, Understanding and proMotion of heritAge Contents) workshop, like its predecessors, focuses on analyzing, processing and valorizing all types of data related to cultural heritage, including tangible and intangible heritage. As stated by UNESCO, cultural heritage provides societies with a wealth of resources inherited from the past, created in the present for the benefit of future generations.

<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The digitisation of large quantities of analogue data and the massive production of born-digital documents for many years now provide us with large volumes of varied multimedia data (images, maps, text, video, 3D objects, multi-sensor data, etc.), an important feature of which is that they are cross-domain. ``Cross-domain'' reflects the fact that these data may have been acquired in very different conditions: different acquisition systems, times and points of view (e.g. a 1962 postcard from the Arc de Triomphe vs. a recent street-view acquisition by mobile mapping of the same monument). These data represent an extremely rich heritage that can be exploited in a wide variety of fields, from Social Sciences and Humanities to land use and territorial policies, including smart city, urban planning, smart tourism and culture, creative media and entertainment. In terms of research in computer science and artificial intelligence, they address challenging problems related to the diversity, specificity and volume of the media, the variety of content descriptors (potentially including the time dimension), the veracity of the data, and the different user needs with respect to engaging with this rich material and the extraction of value out of the data. These challenges are reflected in various research topics such as multimodal and mixed media search, automatic content analysis, multimedia linking and recommendation, and big data analysis and visualisation where scientific bottlenecks may be exacerbated by the time dimension -- which also provides topics of interest such as multimodal time series analysis.

<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="call_for_papers">Call for Papers</h2>
The objective of this workshop is to present and discuss the latest and most significant trends in the analysis, structuring and understanding of multimedia contents dedicated to the valorization of heritage, with the emphasis on enabling access to the big data of the past. We welcome research contributions for the following (but not limited to) topics:

<ul>
	<li>Multimedia and cross-domain data search, interlinking and recommendation</li>
	<li>Dating and spatialization of historical data</li>
	<li>Mixed media data access and indexing</li>
	<li>Multi-modal deep learning</li>
	<li>Deep learning in adverse conditions (transfer learning, learning with side information, etc.)</li>
	<li>Multi-modal time series analysis, evolution modelling </li>
	<li>Multi-modal \& multi-temporal data rendering</li>
	<li>Heritage - Building Information Modelling, Art Virtualisation</li>
	<li>HCI / Interfaces for large-scale datasets</li>
	<li>Smart digitisation of massive quantities of data</li>
	<li>Bench-marking, Open Data Movement</li>
	<li>Generative modelling of cultural heritage</li>
	<li>Machine Learning for Cultural Heritage</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<br>

<h2 class="blackpar_title" id="submission_guide">Submission guidelines</h2>
<b>Submission format</b> All submissions must be original work not under review at any other workshop, conference, or journal. The workshop will accept papers describing completed work as well as work in progress. One submission format is accepted: full paper, which must follow the formatting guidelines of the main conference ACM MM 2023. Full papers should be from 6 to 8 pages (plus 2 additional pages for the references), encoded as PDF and using the ACM Article Template. For author guidelines and instructions, please visit https://www.acmmm2023.org/instructions/.
<br>

<b>Peer Review and publication in ACM Digital Library</b> Paper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. All papers will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field, they will receive at least two reviews. Acceptance will be based on relevance to the workshop, scientific novelty, and technical quality. Depending on the number, maturity and topics of the accepted submissions, the work will be presented via oral or poster sessions. The workshop papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.
